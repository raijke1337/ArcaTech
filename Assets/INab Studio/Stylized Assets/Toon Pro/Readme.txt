Quick setup:

After you have imported the asset into your project, import the package based on the pipeline you are using: 
Either "URP" or "Built-in" by clicking it 2 times.
These .unitypackage files can be found in the asset folder "INab Studio/Stylized Assets/Toon Pro". 

If you are using 2021, after importing "URP/Built-in" .unitypackage file,go to folder "2021 Packages", and import also "URP/Buit-in 2021 - Only Shader" file. 
It contains updated versions of the shader that support 2021 LTS.

You can find demo scenes in the "Demo Scenes" folder. All Toon Pro example materials used in the demo scenes can be found in "Demo Materials" folder.
(Any warnings, missing scripts are results of using the same scenes in URP and Built-In. Please ignore these)

If you wish to modify the shader with the Amplify Shader Editor you can simply open it up and start changing stuff. Custom functions for ASE can be found in "Amplify Funcitons" folder.
